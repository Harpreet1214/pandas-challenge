# My Analysis and Considerations for this project:

1) The percentage of male players in the game is 84%, which is very high as compared to the female player percentage, which is 14%. Looks like the game is really famous with the male players.

2) The age group most interested in the game is between 20-24years, so if the company owning the game would want to increase sales, it should target this age group.

3)Although the most popular item is Final Critic, there is not much difference in the purchase count of Final Critic with the second most popular item, Oathbreaker, last Hope of the Breaking Storm. However, the total purchase value differs by almost $9. Company should try to promote both items with great efforts as these are the most profitable items too.

4) The top spender is Lisosia93 with 5 purchase count and total purchase value of $18.96.
